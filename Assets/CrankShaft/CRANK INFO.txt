A note on this bullshit: The imported version of this file as a position keyframe for Crank 1 and Crank 2.
This would cause the crank to snap left or right of it's original position. In order to fix this, I had to
duplicate the animations for each crank (the original animations in the mesh are read only), and then manually
delete these keyframes, then tell the crank armature to use these new animations.
